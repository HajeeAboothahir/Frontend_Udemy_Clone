# 🎓 Udemy Frontend Clone (HTML + CSS)

This project is a full **frontend UI clone of the Udemy landing page**, built entirely using **HTML5 and CSS3**.

As part of my full-stack development bootcamp at **Error Makes Clever**, I wanted to challenge myself by replicating a modern, professional, and real-world interface — and Udemy was the perfect choice.
